This is a MediaWiki extension used on http://www.politicswiki.ie/Special:ConstituencyFinder
that allows someone to find the relevant constituency using an address


I used the following when creating this:

> jQuery
> Google Maps Api
> Point in Polygon Checking With Google Maps
> The Tally Room - Maps - I changed their version to KML and the names of the polygons to map to urls in the wiki which are released under the same license the originals are jQuery UI
